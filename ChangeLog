== 0.98 July ? 2014

  * Decoupled serialization/deserialization from the model with the new CustomFormat typeclass.

  * TODO: turned Value/TextValue into a typeclass


== 0.97 June 13 2014

  * Memory Levels will now adapt their intervals based on user performance.

  * Moved useMultipleChoiceUntil from global configuration to be tied to individual quiz groups.


== 0.96 March 2 2014

  * Removed SearchResultsContainer in favour of just returning a Try.

  * Removed numCorrectAnswersRequired from the configuration: instead, it is now derived.

  * Changed spaced intervals and started keeping track of response success at each "memory level".


== 0.951 February 2 2014

  * Fine-tuned the use of Streams to avoid OutOfMemoryErrors.

  * Made the simulation tail-recursive to avoid StackOverflowErrors.


== 0.95 January 26 2014

  * Added remote dictionary search, i.e. REST querying of mymemory.translated.net.

  * Added RunDictionary script and fixed dictionary bugs.


== 0.94 January 10 2014

  * The internal partitioning of QuizGroup's is now reflected in the file format.

  * The stream of quiz items in QuizGroupPartition is now loaded as a real stream, i.e. on demand.

  * Added scct for test coverage monitoring.


== 0.93 January 08 2014

  * Little incremental improvements supporting the Android and Play views.


== 0.92 December 18 2013

  * Made constructWrongChoicesRandom() at least ten times more efficient.

  * Cleaned data of duplicates.


== 0.91 December 16 2013

  * Simplification: QuizGroup is persisted directly rather than going through WordMappingGroup.

  * Reintroduced: allow correct responses in quizzes to contain optional parts specified by parentheses.

  * Separator strings are now configurable at the head of each quiz group file.

  * New configuration option to turn off multiple choice in a quiz.


== 0.9 December 8 2013

  * Partitioned QuizGroup's to make the most common query operations very fast and ensure scalability.

  * Introduced some basic simulations for testing performance.


== 0.89 September 30 2013

  * Introduced Scalaz lenses to help update the persistent data structure.

  * Tightened up the data model: introduced the isActive flag for QuizGroup, making it
    unnecessary to persist Quiz metadata.


== 0.88 September 9 2013

  * Implemented minimal Dependency Injection scheme.

  * Miscellaneous code clarity fixes, including changes to false answer generation.


== 0.87 September 3 2013

  * Miscellaneous little fixes, ensuring it works with libanius-android.


== 0.86 September 1 2013

  * Changes to QuizPair, resulting in tweaks throughout the codebase:

    1. QuizPair is now called QuizItem.
    2. "key" is now "prompt".
    3. "value" is now "response" (i.e. the desired response).
    4. The user history of actual responses is separated out from the response field.
    5. prompt and response are contained in Value objects, rather than being simple Strings.


== 0.85 August 31 2013

  * Restructured the data model for clarity and performance

   1. The central quiz processing entity has changed from WordMappingGroup to QuizGroup,
     which has a simpler structure and is thus easier to optimize and use generically.
     There is still a WordMappingGroup, but it is used only for persistence purposes.
   2. Eliminated the concept of range search. It was an increasingly complex optimization that
     should be unnecessary.
   3. Introduced a type parameter for QuizGroups to distinguish between question-answer quizzes
     and word translation quizzes.


== 0.8 August 25 2013

  * Split Libanius into two projects:
   libanius - data model, core processing, and a Console UI
   libanius-android - Android UI, using libanius as a library JAR


== 0.741 August 10 2013

  * Eliminated some mutable state (Dictionary) that was causing a problem.


== 0.74 August 10 2013

  * Fix bugs around range search updating.


== 0.73 August 6 2013

  * Cleanup, including improved error handling with Try.


== 0.72 August 4 2013

  * Dictionary feature re-introduced in the OptionsScreen.


== 0.7 July 29 2013

  * New OptionsScreen to allow selection of QuizGroups (i.e. wmg's) before the QuizScreen.

  * Dictionary feature temporarily suppressed.


== 0.65 July 18 2013

  * Split serialized quiz into separate .wmg files to allow parallel access and hybrid quizzes.

  * Bugfixes and removal of mutable state.


== 0.62 July 11 2013

  * Moved development from Scala 2.9.2 to 2.10.2.

  * Changed Android interface to use Scala Futures rather than Android AsyncTasks.


== 0.6  July 3 2013

  * Converted core types to persistent data structures.

  * Implemented lazy parsing (using Stream and a Lazy Load Proxy with an implicit conversion)
    to ensure the app is quickly available to the user on startup.

  * Removed support for XML quiz format.

  * Changed static properties to a configuration object using com.typesafe.config.


== 0.51  May 29 2013

 * Cleaned up the data a bit, and set the minimum Android API level to Ice Cream Sandwich.


== 0.5  July 20 2012

 * Added a dictionary screen, so that words can be looked up and added to the 
  (front of the) quiz by the user.
 
 
== 0.4  June 4 2012

 * Removed performance bottlenecks, allowing Libanius to work comfortably with 20,000 quiz items, 
  not just 1,000:

  1. Experimented with various collections to find the fastest ones. E.g. the Java HashMap 
    is faster than the Scala mutable HashMap 
  2. For persistence, moved from using XML (very slow on Android) to a custom format. 
    (Also considered using SQLite, but the paradigm shift for this app would be too great.)
  3. Parsing the custom format uses Android's own StringSplitter rather than the slow String.split()
  4. The writing of the custom format uses a single StringBuilder which is passed to all model objects.


== 0.3  May 2012

 * Overhauled the Android GUI to a multiple choice format


== 0.2  late 2011

 * Quiz functionality in Scala on Android


== 0.1  mid-2011

 * Quiz functionality in Scala on a desktop
